tasks_time
===========

This is a collection of tools that is used to research scheduling 
strategies for intrees of tasks that are exponentially distributed.
Other distributions and/or task dependency layouts (such as DAGs)
can be incorporated, but are currently not part of the program.

Components
----------

* tasks: A program that can be used to generate a DAG of snapshots
  and to generate visualization of that DAG. Use `--tikz` and 
  `--dagview` as command line arguments to generate visualization.
* dagviewer.py: A small tool to research the visual output generated
  by the tasks program (`--dagview`) and to adjust and examine the 
  scheduling strategy on demand.

Requirements
------------

* scons is used to build the program, just invoke `scons` to build with
  default parameters. Invoke `scons -h` to get an overview about the
  compilation options.
* gcc4.6.3 (might work with earlier versions and other compilers, though)
* Boost::program_options
* Boost::rational (only if built with `MYFLOAT=3` or `MYFLOAT=4`)
