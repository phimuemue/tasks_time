\section{Current questions}
\label{chap:current-questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Are chain collections optimally scheduled by HLF?
\item P3: Is it possible, that there are -- at one level of the optimal snapshot DAG -- multiple snapshots containing the same intree, but a different set of scheduled tasks?
\item For each snapshot resulting from an optimal schedule, at least one top-most task is scheduled?
\item For each snapshot resulting from an optimal schedule, at least two top-most tasks are scheduled?
\item If for an intree only non-top tasks are scheduled, you can exchange one of the non-top tasks with a top-tasks and obtain a better run time?
\end{itemize}
