\section{Current questions}
\label{chap:current-questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Are chain collections optimally scheduled by HLF?
\item P3: Is it possible, that there are -- at one level of the optimal snapshot DAG -- multiple snapshots containing the same intree, but a different set of scheduled tasks?
\item For each snapshot resulting from an optimal schedule, at least one top-most task is scheduled?
\item For each snapshot resulting from an optimal schedule, at least two top-most tasks are scheduled?
\item If for an intree only non-top tasks are scheduled, you can exchange one of the non-top tasks with a top-tasks and obtain a better run time?
\end{itemize}

\section{Other TODOs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Implement ``examine all trees with certain structure'' in the program.
\item Improve tree generation method so only trees with four or more leaves are output.
\item Appendix containing all tree sequences for which optimal schedule is strictly non-HLF.
\item Improve program by using arrays instead of maps (only for canonical snapshots). \done{Works for canonical snapshots, ``normal ones'' broken.} \todo{Correct it!}
\end{itemize}
