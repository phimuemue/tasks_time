\section{Disproving two intuitive approaches}
\label{sec:p3-disproving-long-p3-and-short-p1-time}

When we want to construct an optimal P3 schedule, we might be tempted to think that (at least) one of the two following criteria should be fulfilled:

\begin{description}
\item[P3L] Try to keep three processors busy as long as possible.
\item[P1S] Try to keep the time where only one processor is busy as short as possible.
\end{description}

Unfortunately, both of them are wrong (at least if considered separately).

Figure \ref{fig:p3-p3l-suboptimal-example} shows an example, where the optimal schedule keeps three processors busy for expected 0.77777 time steps, while a suboptimal schedule keeps three processors busy for a longer expected time, namely about 0.851852 time steps.

From this we can conclude that it may be advantageous in some cases to accept a shorter time with three busy processors, thereby possibly also decreasing the time where only one processor is busy.

  \label{fig:p3-p3l-suboptimal-example}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:p3-p1s-suboptimal-example} shows an intree with the property that the optimal schedule has an expected timespan of roughly 2.59259, within which only one processor is busy. On the other hand, a suboptimal schedule has a timespan of roughly 2.55555 within which only one processor is busy.

This shows that it can be useful to accept a longer time with only one processor busy, probably acchieving a longer time span where three processors are busy.
