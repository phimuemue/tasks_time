\section{Disproving two intuitive approaches}
\label{sec:p3-disproving-long-p3-and-short-p1-time}

When we want to construct an optimal P3 schedule, we might be tempted to think that (at least) one of the two following criteria should be fulfilled:

\begin{description}
\item[P3L] Try to keep three processors busy as long as possible.
\item[P1S] Try to keep the time where only one processor is busy as short as possible.
\end{description}

Unfortunately, both of them are wrong (at least if considered separately).

Figure \ref{fig:p3-p3l-suboptimal-example} shows an example, where the optimal schedule keeps three processors busy for expected 0.77777 time steps, while a suboptimal schedule keeps three processors busy for a longer expected time, namely about 0.851852 time steps.

From this we can conclude that it may be advantageous in some cases to accept a shorter time with three busy processors, thereby possibly also decreasing the time where only one processor is busy.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \caption{An intree whose optimal schedule is expected to keep three processors busy for roughly 0.77777 time steps, while a suboptimal schedule is expected to keep three processors busy for roughly 0.851852 time steps.\todo{See figure \ref{fig:p3-p1s-suboptimal-example}!}}
  \label{fig:p3-p3l-suboptimal-example}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:p3-p1s-suboptimal-example} shows an intree with the property that the optimal schedule has an expected timespan of roughly 2.59259, within which only one processor is busy. On the other hand, a suboptimal schedule has a timespan of roughly 2.55555 within which only one processor is busy.

This shows that it can be useful to accept a longer time with only one processor busy, probably acchieving a longer time span where three processors are busy.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \input{p3/p1s_suboptimal}
  \caption{An intree where the expected time with only one processor being busy is longer within the optimal schedule ($\approx 2.59259$) than within a suboptimal schedule ($\approx 2.555555$).\todo{Write expected times which only one busy processor in subfigures.} \todo{Convert to fractions.}\todo{Which one is optimal? Subfigures!}}
  \label{fig:p3-p1s-suboptimal-example}
\end{figure}

It can also be shown that even combining the two arguments -- in the sense that P3L \emph{or} P1S should be fulfilled for the optimal schedule -- is not correct. This can be observed by examining the intree $(0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3)$. Figure
